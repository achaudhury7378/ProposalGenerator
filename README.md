# AI-Powered Proposal Generator

## Overview

The AI-Powered Proposal Generator is a multi-agent system that collaboratively develops business proposals. It leverages specialized AI agents, each responsible for different aspects of proposal creation, such as market analysis, financial planning, solution design, client engagement, and risk management.

## How It Works

The system simulates a structured role-playing environment where AI agents take turns contributing insights, validating data, and refining the proposal. The Business Analyst leads the process, ensuring alignment across teams.

## AI Agent Roles:
	•	Business Analyst: Leads the proposal creation, synthesizing inputs from all teams.
	•	Market Analysis Expert: Researches industry trends, competitors, and market opportunities.
	•	Financial Planner: Develops financial models, budgets, and revenue projections.
	•	Solution Designer: Defines product/service features and implementation roadmaps.
	•	Client Engagement Specialist: Identifies customer needs and creates engagement strategies.
	•	Risk Manager: Assesses potential risks and develops mitigation plans.

## Workflow
	1.	Define Business Problem: The Business Analyst sets the context.
	2.	Research & Data Gathering: Agents use the ‘search’ tool for market and financial insights.
	3.	Solution Development: The Solution Designer crafts the proposal’s core offering.
	4.	Financial & Risk Assessment: Financial viability and risks are analyzed.
	5.	Final Proposal Structuring: The Business Analyst compiles all inputs into a structured document.
